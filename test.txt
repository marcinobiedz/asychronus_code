While I feel confident in my technical work and overall collaboration, there are still areas where I see room for growth. I’m continuing to build a more complete understanding of the broader product requirements beyond the code itself, which occasionally has led to small regressions. In terms of execution, while I consistently deliver on my tasks, I recognize that some could benefit from tighter time management and sharper prioritization. Lastly, although I aim to lead by example technically, I know I still have steps to take before fully stepping into a lead engineer role. Overall, I see this feedback not as critical, but as part of an ongoing development path I’m committed to.

I see my main strengths in technical expertise and team collaboration. I have a strong understanding of the codebase and architecture, which allows me to identify areas for improvement and communicate them clearly to others. I always aim to provide constructive, actionable feedback in code reviews, and Iâ€™m open to discussions around both the feedback I give and receive. I consistently address comments on my PRs, as I believe in maintaining high code quality and learning through peer input. I also make an effort to support teammates by sharing knowledge and helping them navigate technical challenges. Overall, I see myself as a technically strong team member who contributes actively and positively to the development process.

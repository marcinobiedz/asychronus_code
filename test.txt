Over the past year, I’ve worked closely with him on several core features that required tight coordination between frontend and backend. The work involved frequent changes, quick adaptations to user feedback, and ongoing bug fixing — and throughout, our collaboration was smooth, constructive, and highly effective. I truly appreciated his openness to discussion, technical reliability, and the way he handled challenges under time pressure. It was a very positive experience, and I found him to be a strong and dependable partner in delivering key parts of the project.

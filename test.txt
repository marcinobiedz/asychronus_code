While I don’t have any direct negative feedback, one minor observation is that in some cases, he received initial user feedback earlier than I did, which occasionally led to time pressure on the frontend side during iterations. This didn’t stem from any issue in our collaboration — which I found consistently smooth and constructive — but rather highlights a potential area for improvement in how feedback is distributed and coordinated across roles. Overall, I truly valued working with him and appreciated his responsiveness and adaptability throughout.

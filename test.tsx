Over the course of our year working together, mainly across frontend and backend boundaries, I have not identified any particular challenges or areas needing development from my perspective. As I am neither his manager nor directly involved in his team, my observations are limited to our shared projects, which proceeded without notable problems. Therefore, I do not have any concrete suggestions for improvement at this point.
